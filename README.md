This repository contains the source code for the mobile application named Trash-Go, developed using React Native. The application serves as an E-Report system for waste collection, enabling users to report waste collection needs efficiently. The goal is to enhance waste management practices by facilitating communication between residents and waste management authorities, ensuring timely responses to waste collection requests.

Key Features:

Push Notifications: Keeps users informed about the progress and actions taken on their reports.
Data Management: Enables waste management authorities to manage, analyze, and respond to reported data efficiently.
Technology Stack:

Frontend: React Native for building cross-platform mobile applications that run seamlessly on both Android and iOS.
Backend: Developed using Go (Golang), a powerful and efficient programming language known for its scalability and performance. The backend handles data storage, user authentication, and manages the reports submitted through the mobile app.
APIs: Integration with various APIs for geo-location services, notifications, and other real-time features.
How it Works:

User Reporting: Users can report waste collection issues using the mobile app by submitting details and optionally attaching photos.
Geo-Location Tracking: The app uses GPS to automatically capture the location of the report.
Data Processing: The backend system, developed in Go, processes the report, stores it in the database, and notifies the relevant waste management authorities.
